title: "CMF HT22 Microscopy Analysis"

The goal of this file is to put together all of the information that I have collected during the microscopy trials of the HT22 cells. For these trials, the protocol was changed and dropped to 4 days.  There were a few reasons for this. First, the cell growth behavior changed from before spring break to after spring break.  This is because the cells are getting higher in their n numbers (the number of splits).  Typically, the more you split cells, the more their behavior begins to change.  As such, seperate growth rate data was collected during these 5 day trials to observe the differences in growth between the control and experimental conditions.
