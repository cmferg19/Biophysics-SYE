# Overview
Today the goal is to determine if the system needs to be recalibrated from when I last used it last semester.  Testing consisted of me using my phone and the app *Phyphox* to measure the magnitude of the magnetic field in four different conditions:

Magnetic Field | Arduino System
--------------- | ---------------
On | On
On | Off
Off |On
Off | Off

The initial data makes it look like there aren't any significant shifts from last semester but I'll plot these to take a closer look. 

# Preliminary Data Analysis
```{r}
# set up the environment and import the data
rm(list = ls())

# import the libraries that we need
library(dplyr)
library(here)
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
```

```{r}
# import the data
DF <- read.csv(here("Data","SystemControlTesting_1-24-2023.csv"))

glimpse(DF)
```
